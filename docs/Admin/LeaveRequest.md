### `LeaveRequests` Function Documentation

This function is responsible for handling leave requests for administrators (either Faculty or Warden) once they successfully log in. It assigns the appropriate role (either 'faculty' or 'warden') based on the admin's email, retrieves leave requests, and returns the necessary data to the corresponding view.

#### Functionality:

1. **Session Check**:
   - The function begins by retrieving the current admin session using `Session::get('admin')`. If no admin session exists, it redirects to the login page (`redirect('/')`).
   - If the admin is logged in, their email is extracted (`$adminEmail = $admin->email`).

2. **Role Assignment**:
   - The function checks the email of the logged-in admin to determine their role:
     - **Faculty Check**: It uses the `DB::table('leavereqs')->where('faculty_email', $adminEmail)->exists()` query to verify if the admin's email is listed as a faculty member in the `leavereqs` table.
     - **Warden Check**: Similarly, it checks if the email belongs to a warden using `DB::table('leavereqs')->where('warden_email', $adminEmail)->exists()`.
   - Depending on the query result, the session is updated with the admin's role using `session(['role' => 'faculty'])` or `session(['role' => 'warden'])`.

3. **Fetching Leave Requests**:
   - After determining the role, the function constructs an SQL query (`$fac_war`) to fetch leave requests where either the `faculty_email` or `warden_email` matches the admin's email.
   - The results of this query are stored in the `$students` variable by executing `DB::select($fac_war)`. This holds the leave requests assigned to the logged-in admin.

4. **Leave Extension Count**:
   - In addition to fetching the leave requests, the function counts the number of pending leave extension requests from the `leaveext` table, filtering by either the `faculty_email` or `warden_email`.
   - The total count is stored in the `$leaveextCount` variable using `DB::table('leaveext')->where('faculty_email', $adminEmail)->orWhere('warden_email', $adminEmail)->count()`.

5. **Return View**:
   - Finally, the function returns the `Logins/AdminPages.LeaveRequest` view with two pieces of data:
     - **$students**: The list of leave requests assigned to the admin.
     - **$leaveextCount**: The count of pending leave extension requests.

#### Parameters:

- No parameters are passed into this function explicitly.

#### Returns:

- If the admin is authenticated:
  - A view (`Logins/AdminPages.LeaveRequest`) is returned with two variables:
    - `students`: An array containing leave requests assigned to the faculty or warden.
    - `count`: An integer representing the number of pending leave extension requests.
- If the admin is not authenticated:
  - Redirects the user to the login page (`/`).

### `faculty_approval` Function Documentation

The `faculty_approval` function is responsible for processing faculty approval or rejection of student leave requests. Depending on the faculty's action (accept or decline), it updates the leave request status and handles related database operations. Additionally, when a leave request is declined, it logs the request's details into a leave request history table.

#### Functionality:

1. **Validation**:
   - The function begins by validating the incoming request using `$request->validate()`. It ensures that the field `fac_acc` (faculty action) is provided and is required for the next steps.

2. **Faculty Accepts Leave Request**:
   - If the faculty accepts the request (`$request->fac_acc == "Accept"`):
     - The leave request for the specified student (`$rollno`) is updated in the `leavereqs` table. The field `faculty_adv` is set to `1`, indicating the faculty's approval (`DB::table('leavereqs')->where('rollno',$rollno)->update(['faculty_adv' =>1])`).
     - An event is triggered (`event(new LeaveRequestStatusChanged($rollno, 'accepted'))`) to notify any listeners that the status of the leave request has changed to "accepted."
     - The function then redirects back to the previous page with the `return back()` call.

3. **Faculty Declines Leave Request**:
   - If the faculty declines the request:
     - First, it checks whether the admin is logged in using `Session::get('admin')`. If the session is invalid, the user is redirected to the login page.
     - If the session is valid, the function updates the `leavereqs` table, setting `faculty_adv` to `2`, indicating the faculty's rejection of the leave request.
     - The details of the declined leave request are then retrieved from the `leavereqs` table for the specified student (`$rollno`) and are used to create a new record in the `leavereq_history` table.
     
     - **Populating `leavereq_history`**:
       - A new instance of `leavereq_history` is created (`$result = new leavereq_history()`), and the following fields are populated with data from the student's leave request:
         - `rollno`, `name`, `phoneno`, `placeofvisit`, `purpose`, `outdate`, `outime`, `indate`, `intime`, `noofdays`, `warden`, `faculty_email`, `warden_email`, `faculty_adv` (set to `2`), `status` (set to "Declined"), `remark` (decline reason provided by the faculty), `image`, `gender`, `year`, `course`, and `stud_photo`.
       - After populating these fields, the record is saved to the `leavereq_history` table using `$result->save()`.

     - **Deleting the Leave Request**:
       - Once the history record is saved, the original leave request is deleted from the `leavereqs` table (`DB::table('leavereqs')->where(['rollno'=> $rollno])->delete()`), ensuring that the declined request is no longer active.

     - **Fetching Pending Leave Requests**:
       - The function fetches all remaining pending leave requests assigned to the admin (faculty or warden) by querying the `leavereqs` table (`DB::select($fac_war)`), where the `faculty_email` or `warden_email` matches the logged-in admin's email.
       - The results are stored in the `$students` variable.

     - Finally, the function returns to the previous page (`return back()`). 

4. **Fallback Redirection**:
   - If the admin session is not valid, the function redirects the user to the login page (`redirect('/')`).

#### Parameters:

- **$request**: The incoming HTTP request containing the faculty's action (accept or decline) and, in case of rejection, the reason for declining.
- **$rollno**: The roll number of the student whose leave request is being processed.

#### Returns:

- **On Successful Approval**:
  - Redirects back to the previous page with the leave request marked as accepted.
- **On Successful Decline**:
  - Records the declined leave request into the history, deletes the original request, and redirects back to the previous page.
- **On Session Invalid**:
  - Redirects to the login page (`/`).

### `warden_approval` Function Documentation

The `warden_approval` function handles the warden's decision (approval or rejection) on student leave requests. It verifies the faculty's approval status, processes the warden's decision, updates the leave request in the database, and, if approved, generates a barcode for the leave request.

#### Functionality:

1. **Validation**:
   - The function begins by validating the incoming request (`$request->validate()`) to ensure the `war_acc` (warden's action) is provided.

2. **Fetching Student Data**:
   - It retrieves the studentâ€™s leave request details from the `leavereqs` table using the student's roll number (`$rollno`) and stores it in the `$student` variable.

3. **Warden Accepts the Leave Request**:
   - If the warden accepts the leave request (`$request->war_acc == "Accept"` or `$request->war_acc == "Paccept"` for provisional acceptance):
     - **Faculty Approval Check**:
       - It first checks if the leave request has been approved by the faculty advisor by examining the `faculty_adv` field. If the faculty approval is required but not granted, the function returns with a message: `Faculty Advisors Approval Needed!`.
     - **Admin Session Check**:
       - If the admin session is valid (`Session::get('admin')`), the leave request's `warden` field is updated to `1` (approved by warden) in the `leavereqs` table.
     - **Storing the Approved Leave Request in History**:
       - A new `leavereq_history` record is created to log the details of the approved leave request.
       - The `leavereq_history` fields are populated with:
         - Student details: `rollno`, `name`, `phoneno`, `placeofvisit`, `purpose`, `outdate`, `outime`, `indate`, `intime`, `noofdays`, `faculty_email`, `warden_email`, `faculty_adv`, `image`, `gender`, `year`, `course`, `stud_photo`.
         - The `status` field is set to `"Approved"` or `"Provisionally Approved"` based on the warden's decision (`$request->war_acc == "Paccept"`).
     - **Generating a Barcode**:
       - A barcode is generated for the leave request using the `Picqer\Barcode\BarcodeGeneratorPNG` library. The barcode is stored in the public disk at `'barcodes/'` with a name format of `<rollno>_<outdate>.png`, and the path is saved in the `barcode` field of the `leavereq_history` record.
     - **Deleting the Original Leave Request**:
       - The original leave request is deleted from the `leavereqs` table after the history record is saved.
     - The function then returns back to the previous page.

4. **Warden Declines the Leave Request**:
   - If the warden declines the leave request (`$request->war_acc != "Accept"`):
     - **Faculty Approval Check**:
       - Similar to the acceptance flow, it checks if faculty approval is required. If not approved, the function returns a message: `Faculty Advisors Approval Needed!`.
     - **Admin Session Check**:
       - If the admin session is valid (`Session::get('admin')`), the leave request's `warden` field is updated to `2` (declined by warden).
     - **Storing the Declined Leave Request in History**:
       - A new `leavereq_history` record is created to log the details of the declined leave request.
       - The fields are populated similarly to the approval case, but the `status` is set to `"Declined"` and the reason for declining (`$request->decline_reason`) is stored in the `remark` field.
     - **Deleting the Original Leave Request**:
       - The original leave request is deleted from the `leavereqs` table after the history record is saved.
     - The function then returns back to the previous page.

5. **Fallback Redirection**:
   - If the admin session is not valid, the function redirects the user to the login page (`redirect('/')`).

#### Parameters:

- **$request**: The incoming HTTP request containing the warden's action (accept, provisional accept, or decline) and, in the case of rejection, the reason for declining.
- **$rollno**: The roll number of the student whose leave request is being processed.

#### Returns:

- **On Successful Approval or Decline**:
  - Records the leave request in the history table, generates a barcode if approved, and deletes the original leave request. Redirects back to the previous page.
- **On Faculty Approval Missing**:
  - Returns back to the previous page with the message "Faculty Advisors Approval Needed!" if the faculty's approval is required but missing.
- **On Session Invalid**:
  - Redirects to the login page (`/`).

### `show_leave_det` Function Documentation

The `show_leave_det` function is responsible for displaying the leave request history for an admin, either a faculty member or warden. It retrieves the leave request data specific to the logged-in admin based on their email and presents it in a view.

#### Functionality:

1. **Admin Session Check**:
   - The function first checks if the admin is logged in by retrieving the admin session using `Session::get('admin')`.
   - If the session is valid (i.e., the admin is logged in), the function proceeds to the next steps.
   - If the session is not valid, the function redirects the user to the login page (`redirect('/')`).

2. **Fetching Leave Request History**:
   - It retrieves the logged-in admin's email from the session (`$admin->email`).
   - A SQL query is executed using `DB::select()` to fetch the leave request history from the `leavereq_histories` table where either the faculty or warden email matches the admin's email.
   - The records are ordered by the `outdate` field in descending order to show the most recent leave requests first.

3. **Returning the View**:
   - The leave request data, stored in `$students`, is passed to the `Logins.AdminPages.LeaveReqHistory` view, where it will be displayed.
   - The function then returns this view with the retrieved data (`['students' => $students]`).

#### Parameters:

- **None**: The function does not take any parameters.

#### Returns:

- **On Successful Session Check**:
  - Returns the `Logins.AdminPages.LeaveReqHistory` view, populated with the leave request history of students that are either under the faculty or warden associated with the logged-in admin's email.
- **On Invalid Session**:
  - Redirects the user to the login page (`redirect('/')`) if the admin session is not valid.

#### Key Details:

- **Session Dependency**:
  - The function is dependent on the session data to determine if an admin is logged in and to identify which email is associated with the logged-in admin.
  
- **SQL Query**:
  - The SQL query retrieves leave request history records from the `leavereq_histories` table, specifically where the `faculty_email` or `warden_email` matches the logged-in admin's email.
  - The results are ordered by the `outdate` field in descending order, meaning the most recent leave requests are shown first.

- **Redirection**:
  - If no valid session is found, the user is redirected to the login page, preventing unauthorized access to the leave request history.
